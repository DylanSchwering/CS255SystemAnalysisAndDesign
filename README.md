# CS255SystemAnalysisAndDesign

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was for the client DriverPass. The team was contracted to build a system to prepare student drivers for their drivers’ tests. The system would be able to offer online classes, practice tests, schedule in person driving training, manage schedules, generate reports and keep up to date on DMV requirements.

What did you do particularly well?
I did well on defining the requirements for the project as well as conveying these requirements in a manner that all parties involved can understand.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I were to revise the documents, I would choose to provide examples for each section and make sure that my descriptions were in-depth enough.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the users’ needs by reviewing all past communication with them, including the interviews and the follow-up communications.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software with modularity in mind, trying to keep the code that makes up the software condensed to its own snippets. The techniques I would like to use in the future is implementing testing to make sure that my software works well in all use cases.
